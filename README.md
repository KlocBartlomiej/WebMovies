# WebMovies
Simple app for adding movies to collection and adding comments about them.
This app is being built on request of my friend, so I'll try to add info
in the commit messages, about some requirements, to keep track which commit
accomplishes which requirement.

# How to start
Execute command inside this project directory: `php -S <addressIP>:<Port> -t public` eg. `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
